# CAFFE-Framework

This is the online appendix of the paper _“Toward Systematic Counterfactual Fairness Evaluation of Large Language Models: The CAFFE Framework.”_ 

It provides a comprehensive framework for fairness testing of language models using counterfactual scenarios, along with experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.


## Structure
```
├── Caffe/        # Source code for the framework for fairness testing
├── Experiments/  # Experiments in Jupyter Notebooks
```

The full implementation of the **CAFFE** framework is shared in the Caffe/ directory. The source code in Jupyter Notebook is commented to support the reusability and reproducibility of the framework.

## Note
Each folder and subfolder includes a dedicated README file with specific instructions on how to run and use the components within the package.
